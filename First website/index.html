    <h2>
        Hey Sumit ! how are you?
    </h2>
<p class="para1">
 <strong>This is my first website i created using html. </strong>Flibberflop the wizzlewump danced on a 
 moonbeam, sipping glorpjuice from a twizzlecup while humming the ancient tune of “Zarblenocks 
 Lament.” Quibblesnort and his band of flangleberries jiggled through the snorfle tunnel, cha after
 the elusive blibberblat that stole their snoozlehorn. Meanwhile, the sky turned a shade of blorpurple
 as the sun hiccupped and sneezed glitter onto the flumbuzzle fields. “Gribble me timbers!” shouted 
 Captain Snazzlepuff<br>
 whose beard was made entirely of spaghetti code and marshmallow logic. The
 trees, tired of standing, took a nap midair, floating gently on the breeze of forgotten Tuesdays.
 A flock of yoodlebugs performed synchronized interpretive dance while reciting the alphabet
 backward in Klingon. Suddenly, a quantum banana exploded into a thousand existential questions, each 
 one answered by a sock puppet named Reginald. “Bloopity bloop,”. <hr>

<em> Snizzlefritz wobbled through the glumbuzzle marsh, juggling three squeaky sprockets and a </em>
 moonpickle. The air smelled faintly of quantum marmalade as the flibberwumps sang lullabies to the 
 upside-down tulip trees. “Zoodle me sideways!” barked the glittertoad, launching into a tap dance atop
  a levitating pancake. Meanwhile, the sky burped out a rainbow of sentient marshmallows, each
 whispering secrets in Esperanto. Blorpington the third declared it was officially Wobbleday, and all
 clocks melted in celebration. A single noodle floated by, humming Beethoven’s 9th in reverse. And 
 thus, the universe hiccupped, giggled, and resumed its regularly scheduled nonsense.
